 Is it on?  Thanks, though.  All right, let's do this.  Hi, I'm Jake Harper, and this is the human volcano.  We begin by drinking a warm can of Diet Coke.  That's not Coke, dude.  Yeah, my dad did the shopping.  Anyway, a warm Diet Cola product.  Now, I will swallow a mentos.  Mentos.  Now, I'll land the floor.  Goggles?  Right. Safety first.  You feel anything yet?  Oh, yeah. It's working.  If it starts coming out the back door,  pull your pants down and roll over.  Good thinking.  Hey, what's going on?  Not a good time, Dad.  What are you doing on the floor?  What the hell are you doing?  Sorry, I'm sorry.  Are you all right?  Yeah, we were just making a video.  Hold on.  Cool stunts.  Cool stunts?  In God's name, what?  You've heard of Jackass?  Yeah.  We are dumbass.  Really?  However, I don't know what you're talking about.  Really?  However, did you come up with that name?  Well, we were thinking,  what's better than Jackass?  No, it's kind of a rhetorical question.  Oh, it wasn't that hard.  It came down to a choice between dumbass and the Asceteers.  I think we made the right call.  Really?  Oh, yes.  I applaud your decision.  The plan is we shoot a bunch of cool stunts,  post them online, and then sell advertising.  Who on earth would advertise on that?  Well, right off the bat, we figured Coke and Mentos.  It's a product placement bananza.  Come on.  Let's go upload a premiere episode.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  What about this mess?  Damn it.  Let me take care of that hit so I'm 90.  Please, God, don't make me live that below.  You'll never guess who I went into at the supermarket.  Rose.  Oh, she's back from our honeymoon.  Yep.  Let me down the beach for their new husband.  Oh, good for her.  Yeah.  Good for her.  You have to forget about her, Charlie.  I know.  That's why I got me some milk of amnesia.  Nice.  What are you doing down there?  Wiping up cola vomit.  My sun's spewed in my face.  Oh, great. The human volcano worked.  You do about this?  That was my idea.  You're kidding.  Yeah, I'm like a great first episode of The Asceteers.  Actually, I think they went with dumbass.  Damn, I already had a bunch of t-shirts made up.  M-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m.
