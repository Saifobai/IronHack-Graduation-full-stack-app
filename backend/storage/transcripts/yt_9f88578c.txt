 Okay, let's take a look at what we've got here.  Okay, now is this too much pressure?  No.  Okay, how about this?  No.  Okay, now is this where the spasms occur?  A little lower.  Okay.  Here?  Oh, lower.  Here?  Oh, oh.  Am I hurting you?  No, God, no.  Oh, oh.  Nobody's touched me like this since my husband died.  Oh, I'm so sorry.  How long has it been?  Oh.  That long, huh?  Oh.  Oh.  Oh, my.  It's pretty sensitive here.  Harder.  Okay, problem.  So just out of curiosity, how did you find me?  The referral.  My website, or the flyers on the counter,  or the Mongolian barbecue across the street.  Shut up and rub.  I'm not technically rubbing.  I'm not stopping.  Oh, spank me.  I'm sorry?  Spank my lonely ass.  What?  Do as best.  Yes, Dr. Harper.  Yes.  Oh, God, yes.  Okay, let's take a look at the schedule.  The rest of the afternoon looks like,  oh, that's not too bad.  So how are you liking your first day of work here?  Thank you, Dr. Harper.  You are most welcome.  And remember,  alternating an ice pack with a heating pad  is very helpful for spasming.  I'd like to make another appointment.  Oh, sure, sure.  What were you thinking maybe next week?  Tonight.  Tonight?  Oh, oh, Gloriausky.  Well, we close up at five.  So I can expect you at my place at nine.  Oh, gee.  I don't know.  I expect you at my place at nine.  Oh, gee.  I don't do house calls.  Per se.  See you at nine.  Some patients pay in cash.  Their insurance won't cover chiropractic.  Part of our ongoing health care crisis.  A tragic, really.  By the way, you are doing one heck of a job.  In fact, here's a little something for you.  Those are smile lights up the place.  You know what, let's sweeten the pot.  Um, can you give me ten back?  Not a problem.  Can't for price on a smile.  Man, man, man, man, man.
