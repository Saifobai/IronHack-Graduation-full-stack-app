 Okay, homework's taken care of.  He's taking a shower.  You may want to check in on him in a few minutes.  Make sure he's not goofing around in there.  Where are you going?  Oh, I have dinner plans.  Really?  Yeah, hard to believe, huh?  I didn't say that. I'm happy for you.  Well, thank you.  And again, I'm sorry I overreacted the other night.  I really do want us to have the kind of friendship that can be, you know,  mutually supportive.  Me too.  You'll go up. I'll go up.  Right.  So, is this someone you've been seeing for a while?  Yeah, uh, uh, a while.  Um, but, you know, not exclusive.  I don't want to get side down.  Oh, well, that must be Camille.  Shoot picks you up?  Well, what can I say?  It's a new world, Judith.  Hey, y'all, wow.  You are so good for my ego.  Hi, Charlie.  Hi, Camille.  Hello, I'm Judith.  Your Alan's ex?  Wow, I didn't expect you to be so...  You're looking.  Thank you.  I mean, you have such beautiful skin for the mother of an 11-year-old.  Oh, thank you.  Okay, well, we should get going.  It was nice meeting you.  Uh-huh.  I just hope I look half as good as her when I'm that old.  I'm betting you will.  Man, I don't know how he does it.  I made a big play for her. Nothing.  She's so young.  Yeah, some guys like that.  I'm going to hand it to you, Judith.  You were very mature about the whole thing.  I guess that's because you were a very mature woman.  Yes, thanks.  Jake, say goodbye to Mommy.  She's going home.
